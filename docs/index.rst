Doc-Gen allows you to free your code files from documentation. Doc-Gen
allows you to store docstrings in a json file, but still have them readable
by documentation building tools.

.. note::

   Tools like Sphinx cannot detect changes in the docstrings. In order to update
   documentation, these tools must be forced to rebuild the documentation.

It uses a simple interface and a beautiful wizard to make documentation, but it
also integrates with existing docstrings! Using this tool, you can create documentation
without bloating your code files.
